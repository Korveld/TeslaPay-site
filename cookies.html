            <div class="flex flex-col gap-6">
              <p>In this Cookie Policy (hereinafter, the Policy), we inform you about the technologies used on this website that help ensure the proper functioning of the website or monitor and analyse the behaviour of visitors of the website during their browsing sessions.</p>

            <h4>WHAT ARE COOKIES?</h4>
            <div class="flex flex-col gap-6">
              <p>A cookie is a small text file that a website sends to your web browser when you visit it and stores it on the device that you are using. For this reason, the site may “remember” your actions and options (such as registration name, language, font size, and other display options) for a certain period of time so that you do not have to re-enter them each time you visit the site.The websites use own/first party and/or third-party cookies. According to the function they perform, the cookies classify to:</p>
              
              <ul>
                <li>Required cookies. These cookies activate the basic browsing or access functions of the website. Without these cookies, the website will not work properly.</li>
                <li>Functional or technical cookies. These cookies help personalize the webpage by remembering the visitor’s preferences and settings, such as his/her language choice or his/her geographic region.</li>
                <li>Statistical or analytic cookies that collect anonymous information and provide reports from which the website manager can learn how visitors use the website.</li>
                <li>Marketing or advertising cookies. They are used to track visitors on many websites to serve advertising that are tailored to them. They also limit the number of advertisings displayed and help evaluate the effectiveness of advertising campaigns. These are mostly cookies from third-party advertisers.</li>
              </ul>
              
              <p>Cookies are divided into session and persistent cookies according to their validity period.</p>
              
              <p>In terms of the location of their creation, there are two types of cookies:</p>
              
              <ul>
                <li>First-party or own cookies are created on the website that you are visiting.;</li>
                <li>Third-party cookies are created by other websites. As a rule, these sites own and include certain content, such as ads or images, that appears on the website you are visiting,</li>
              </ul>
              
              <p>Trackers and digital fingerprinting are more sophisticated technologies that work without cookies (files stored on the user’s device). For example, when a webpage uses tracking pixels / tags, a 1-pixel “image” is loaded each time a user accesses a particular webpage element, so that the server learns that a particular user with a specific IP address was in that webpage element, and that information is stored on the server. If the user does not consent to the collection of personal data, such elements of the website are disabled immediately. Digital IDs are highly accurate, generated by a user’s smart device, and unique IDs allow the same user to be identified at any time later.</p>
              
              <p>Web beacons, uXDT, or Ultrasonic tracking technology work in such a way that when a website is visited, the computer generates an ultrasonic signal that is inaudible to humans but received by other smart devices running a certain app at the same time. The use of this technology requires a data protection impact assessment</p>
