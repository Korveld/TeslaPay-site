              <p>7.1. As a regulated financial institution, TeslaPay is required by law to store some of your personal and transactional data beyond the closure of your account with us. Your data is only accessed internally on a need to know basis, and it will only be accessed or processed if necessary.</p>
              <p>7.2. We will delete data that is no longer required for the purposes stated in this Privacy Policy or / and relevant law or jurisdiction in which we operate.</p>
              <p>7.3. In order to fulfil the requirements relating to the protection of personal data and legal certainty, that retention period is fixed at 8 (eight) years after the end of a business relationship or of an occasional transaction. However, if necessary, for the purposes of prevention, detection or investigation of money laundering and terrorist financing, and after carrying out an assessment of the necessity and proportionality, TeslaPay may perform the further retention of records for a period not exceeding an additional 2 (two) years.</p>
              <p><b>Please note:</b> Retention periods could be subject to change, depending on your location, regulatory requirements, or other legal obligations that we need to adhere to.</p>
